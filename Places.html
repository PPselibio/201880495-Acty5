                             Spend a little time at Bancalaan port and enjoy a beautiful scene of locals 
                             rowing their locally made boats called “kiring kiring”, 
                             a puppet boat reminiscent of “faluwa” of Batanes. If you want to stay longer 
                             in the island, perhaps for a day, try to visit the small community of Tabodniayo 
                             which masters the art of making woodships and colorful, native mats.</p>

                         it makes up for with its underwater scenes. The island has a naturally

                  Bathing is not a problem as there is good water supply in the 
                  island; there is also a bath area with 5 toilets, and electricity 
                  is made available through a generator. When it comes to network connectivity,
                   Candaraman Island enjoys a good signal strength for both Globe and Smart networks.

         its clear waters are only few inches deep and its seabed are
          splattered with soft sands that feel slushy on the feet.

    <span>Top 2. Punta Sibaring 2</span>
 </div>
 <div class ="design-title">
     <p>Stringrays mostly frequent especially in the morning<br>On a
         personal note, Punta Sibaring 2 has the most refined sands
          in all of Balabac islands. It’s too powdery that your feet 
          would naturally sink as you step on the sand whether its 
          a wet or dry surface. For this very reason, the shores of
          Sibaring is often frequented by stingrays as it make for 
          a good hideout while they rest. Stingrays are venomous creatures; 
          although docile, they can become reactive and may whip their tail 
          as defense against any moving threat. Hence, it is customary for 
          boatmen to check any sightings of stingray on the sands using their
           paddle before allowing guests to get down from the boat.

 </div>
 <div class ="design-title">
     <p>Is often most hailed and talked about among all islands.<br> 
        Onuk (or Onok) Island is often the most hailed and talked about among
         all islands in Balabac, which comes as no surprise. The island is 
         engulfed with white, floury sands that extend to a 5-meter wide 
         reef where sightings of green sea turtles and pink dolphins await.
          Its waters are disposed with cylinders of light as it shades 
          change from fluorescent to deep blue. To me, Onuk Island is 
          the very example of a top-down tropical paradise.</p>

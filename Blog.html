                        <h2>BALABAC: “The Last Frontier of the Philippines Last Frontier”</h2>

                    <p>
                        A few months ago, me and my tour guide group decided to explore Balabac, the southernmost municipality of Palawan.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        Balabac is geographically near Malaysia than the rest of the Philippines and has strong connection with that country owing to its location and the fact that the place has a predominant Muslim population like Malaysia.
                        It was the first time for all of us to explore this part of Palawan. Even though we are tour guides and are expected to have traveled to most areas of Palawan, we had apprehension to go to Balabac at first because the area is sensationally portrayed by
                        media as a trouble spot adding to the fact that the place has no established tourism system. We had no contact, no accommodation and were completely clueless on how to go about with our trip.
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <p>
                        It was timely, one of my facebook friends, Jay Cuario happened to be organizing a group to explore Balabac but upon inquiry I learned that his schedule and ours do not match so I instead get his contact in Balabac so we can schedule our tour on a separate date. I wasted no time in contacting the family of Jay’s friend, Lydz Alpha who shall be our host for the tour. They were very accommodating and agreed on our desired itinerary.
